# Centroid
A centroid calculator for the human body in 2d.

## How to use:

####**1. Up-load a picture**

- Find a nice picture of the human body on the Web and copy the URL.
- Paste the image URL in the **"Image URL..."** input box.
- Click **"Load image"** button.

Once the image is loaded, you are ready to start creating body sections.

####**2. Sketch the body sections**
- Choose the body section you want to sketch in the **"Body sections"** dropdown menu.
- Click for every node of the body section you're sketching. A small dot will appear.
- When you are done with the section, click **"Done!"** button.
- Repeat to sketch the remaining body sections.

Now that you finished sketching all the body sections, you can now calculate the whole system centroid.

####**3. Find the centroid of the system:**
- Click the **Centroid** button to calculate and place the system centroid.

If you need the data in CSV format, click **to CSV** button and copy from the **Event log** text area.

## Bonus:
There is a **"Body section"** called **"Free shape"**.
Use it to find geometric center of sketched figures.

## Troubleshoot:
If your image does not display complete, try to resize the window to resemble the aspect ratio of the picture (the canvas size corresponds to the viewport size) .

There is a lot to fix. Step by step!
